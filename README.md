# Fuzzing Crypto

## Dependencies

Docker, amd64 architecture

## Instructions to run

```bash
sudo bash -c "echo core >/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern" # to enable afl++ fuzzing
bash build.sh
bash run.sh
```
A terminal within the container will open.

### To run experiments on liboqs

To run experiments on version:
- 2018-11, replace `ver_liboqs` with `old_liboqs` below.
- 0.4.0, replace `ver_liboqs` with `mid_liboqs` below.
- 0.8.0, replace `ver_liboqs` with `cur_liboqs` below.

Within the container, run
```bash
export LIBOQS=ver_liboqs
make ${LIBOQS}                                                    # to install dependences
python3 fuzz_liboqs.py --liboqs ${LIBOQS} --logfile ${LIBOQS}.log # to run experiments
python3 report.py --liboqs ${LIBOQS}                              # to collect results
```

Consider uncommenting the values in `BLACKLIST` on lines 35-42 of `fuzz_liboqs.py`.

### To run experiments on supercop 20240107
Within the container
```bash
make supercop                                                     # to install supercop and run experiments
python3 supercop_report.py                                        # to collect results
```

## Reports

The reports generated by the code above can be found inside `/reports/`, which is mounted as a volume within the docker container. The reports are generated in three formats, as SQLite database, as Excel file and as a Latex table.

The reports from the experiments described in the paper can be found in `/paper_reports/`.
The SQLite format was omitted due to the size of the databases.
